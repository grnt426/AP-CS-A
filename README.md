AP CS A Sample Programs
=============

This repository stores several sample programs to demonstrate to the students the kinds of
things they can create with the concepts they are learning. Some show them something just
outside of what they have learned to better see the cool kinds of things they can do with
programming.

TurtleStuff
-------

This package shows three different kinds of fractal algorithms that can be drawn 
with Turtle. The Turtle tool allows students to draw lines and shapes on the screen by
telling a turtle to move around.

Sierpinsky Fractal shows a triangle recursively sub-divided.

Snowflake is an animation of a modified Koch Snowflake that illustrates how the fractal
looks when triangles are drawn on the sides of a triangle.

TriangleSpiral draws slightly irregular polygons with increasing side length and minor
rotation to create a spiral.

**Requirements**: All can be run self-contained with Java 11.
